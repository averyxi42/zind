Submitting Bugs, Features, and other Feedback
---------------------------------------------

We use `Github Issues <https://github.com/zillow/zind/issues>`_ to track all kinds of feedback around ZInD.
Before creating a new issue, please search through the list to see if your bug or feature has already been reported. If not, feel free to open a new one.

For bugs on the provided ZInD scripts, please include:
- As much detailed information as you have about the bug itself
- A minimal code example that reproduces the bug behavior
- Your python version (``python --version``)
- Versions for all packages in use (``pip list``)
- Make sure to label the issues as ``bug``

For new features and enhancements, please include:
- An explanation of the feature
- How it would work (code examples would be great)
- Benefits and scope
- If your enhancement involves a new set of annotations, acquired by you and not currently available by ZInD, those will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

Fixing bugs and implementing features
-------------------------------------

Look through our `issue board <https://github.com/zillow/zind/issues>`_ with either ``kind:bug`` or ``kind:feature``. We prefer every pull request to include the following:

- A link to the issue being fixed (please use Github's syntax like "Closes #number")
- Code changes itself
- Test cases
- Documentation changes if there are any behavior or function, class, or object signature changes
